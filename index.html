        <h4>Part 0: Prologue</h4>
        <p>Eloise Beaumont was born 22 July 1992 into a rich family in Palto Alto, California. She was the best in the class until second grade (1999 – 2000), when she witnessed a school bully, Alice (4th grade at that time) walking by. Everyone suddenly shushed and bowed to her, but Eloise. She almost got beat up for not bowing to her. Eloise started to realize that popularity could be earned by fear – and she started thus being a bully. In January 2001, Alice was defeated by Eloise, and the victor decided to make a gang of bullies. Even though Eloise was told on many times, her rich parents always fish her out from the drain of danger. The horrible part was she made people do her bidding the whole day; they were treated as her “playthings”. After getting beaten up many times by “weak people” in 2007, Eloise decided to step away from bullying and focus on her academics once more. After graduating high school, finishing college, and pursuing a career of finance for more than five years, she started to date Stephane, a medical school student, in 2016.</p>
        <p>Stephane Renard was born 26 July 1994, with a birthday 4 days after Eloise, into a middle-class family in San Francisco, California. Books were quite scarce in his family, so he went often to the library to learn more. He would borrow 10 to 15 books at a time, learning about different aspects – by the age of 9, he learned all the words necessary to take the SAT. When he saw the 9/11 attack in 2001, he briefly thought of being a soldier, but unfortunately, he didn’t have too much strength to do so. Instead, he decided to be a medical school student and went to Stanford for four years, finishing in 2020. Right at that time, it was the COVID-19 pandemic, so he opened three clinics to treat patients of the COVID-19 disease.</p>
        <p>After his relationship with Eloise fell apart in 2017, he started dating Katz Ridner the year later, the (later) receptionist of his clinic in the story. After it fell apart in 2020 due to a disagreement over toilet paper supplies, he started trying to date Melissa Blackburne, a doctor in his clinic. She didn’t have much interest for him in the beginning, but it kind of caught on. The couple broke up due to Melissa’s irrational temper.</p>
        <p>The couple had met before, in 2016 while colliding with each other in the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) multiple times. Eloise wanted to go to New York and Stephane went to San Diego to meet up with friends. They were almost towards their wedding… but a sad disagreement happened…</p>
        <h4>Part 1: How to Be Alone</h4>
        <p>The kitchen of Eloise’s condo was feeling tense and heated that the neighbors couldn’t stop fuming about the constant lobbing of items that Eloise hurled at Stephane like when she used to be a school bully; toilet paper rolls, napkins, plastic forks… it was unbearable. The atmosphere of both French and English insults choked them both. They were fighting about the future of their finances; Stephane, a 23 year old, wanted to invest them first, then have fun with them, but on the contrary, Eloise, a 25 year old, wanted to have some fun with it first. The lobbing of items just made Stephane more eager to leave. Finally, he couldn’t take it anymore – he stopped Eloise midsentence.</p>
        <p>“Eloise. I’m leaving,” he said. “This relationship is going nowhere. I wish you good luck, but it’s over.”</p>
	    <p>Eloise realized the mistake she had made repeatedly. Her eyes suddenly filled with tears as she backed away… she was spellbound by his sudden decision… dammit…</p>
        <p>“You… you can’t leave me…” she muttered, trying to get him to stay. “We’ll sort it out together and get it back…”</p>
	    <p>But Stephane knew it was Eloise’s excuse for him to stay; if he did, they would start the whole argument again, and never reach an ending point. The French medical school student made up his mind and left Eloise behind… he raced down the stairs with Eloise chasing after him, begging. Finally, he got into his car – but Eloise was grabbing a door handle of it. He wrangled Eloise’s hand off and drove off in a patch of dust, letting her to sob. She collapsed to the ground, not caring if anyone saw her like this. The love of her life was gone forever. The best moments of her life were gone…</p>
